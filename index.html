        <h4>HTML + CSS</h4>
        <p>I have a foundational understanding of how to implement my designs with HTML and CSS. This knowledge assists in communicating with a multidisciplinary team to execute complex design strategies. Understanding the potential as well as the limitations of these languages allows me to make efficient creative choices so as to avoid backtracking on a decision that was made early on in the design process. For a sample of what I can do, look no further than design and responsiveness of this portfolio.</p>
        <h4>Figma + Adobe XD</h4>
        <p>These tools are integral to working remotely and collaboratively. I can craft templates, wireframes, user flows, and prototypes for various stages of user-testing. I often used both of these programs to demonstrate the final mockups of the work presented in my case studies. </p>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>I am actively looking to further my skills in user research and testing. The insights that can be synthesized from users almost always reveals a surprising discovery. Being able to empathize and understand how users are approaching using card sorting methods, surveys, and A/B testing as I have done in past is absolutely crucial to any iterative design process. These tests and insights have influenced nearly every aspect of my case studies.</p>
        <h4>User Testing</h4>
        <p>We can develop our ideas to near perfection (as if there is such a thing) but if the value and goals of the project are not communicated clearly, the impact of that project is greatly reduced. I take great pride in being able to confidently present ideas in a public setting. I am able to justify my creative decisions by presenting relevant data, communicate measurable KPIs, and outline a direct path the team can take to achieve those goals.</p>
